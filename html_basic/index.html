 <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>My journey into web development began with learning HTML and CSS, and has grown into a deep commitment to writing accessible and efficient code.</p>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I am Ernest Solomon. I'm a web developer dedicated to creating clean, functional, and responsive websites. I have a passion for problem-solving and a strong interest in technology.</p>
  <h3>My Projects</h3>
  <p>I've worked on a variety of projects, including personal websites, landing pages, and interactive applications. Each project taught me something new and pushed me to improve my coding and design skills.</p>
